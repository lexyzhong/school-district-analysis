# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The school board has requested for the following analyses to be performed and presented in a table format:
- district summary
- school summary
- top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing percentage
- average math score by grade level for each school
- average reading score by grade level for each school
- scores by school spending per student
- scores by school size
- scores by school type

After learning about the possible occurence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, the math and reading scores for all ninth grade students at this school were then excluded from the calculations. The impact of excluding these scores on each of the aforementioned metrics will be discussed.
